We are first starting with movielens dataset. The dataset is split into two parts with 9:1 ratio for train and test resp.

You can download dataset from here and paste in data folder
https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip

This will be regression problem. As we have explicit ratings here.


To run this project.
$python trainer.py


I have also included script to hypertune the parameters.



The best test loss was found to be 0.9240.
